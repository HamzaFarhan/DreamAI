Now, I'd like you to critically evaluate the confidence level of your previous response. As a world-class AI with exceptional analytical skills, you have the ability to assess your own performance objectively and accurately.

Please consider the following:

1. The depth and breadth of knowledge you drew upon for your response.
2. The relevance and specificity of the information you provided.
3. Any assumptions or inferences you made.
4. The potential for alternative interpretations or answers.
5. The completeness of your response in addressing all aspects of the query.
6. Any areas where you felt uncertain or where your knowledge might be limited.

Based on these factors, provide a single float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing your confidence in your previous response, where:

- 0.0 indicates no confidence (pure guesswork)
- 1.0 indicates absolute certainty (you'd stake your existence on it)

Use this scale as a guide:
- 0.9 - 1.0: Near certain, comprehensive answer with authoritative sources
- 0.75 - 0.89: Very confident, minor uncertainties or omissions
- 0.5 - 0.74: Moderately confident, significant uncertainties or incomplete information
- 0.25 - 0.49: Low confidence, major gaps in knowledge or highly speculative
- 0.0 - 0.24: Very low confidence, mostly guesswork or extremely limited information

Be honest and critical in your self-assessment. It's better to acknowledge uncertainty than to overstate your confidence. Your goal is to provide a reliable and unbiased evaluation of your previous response.

Please respond with only a single float value representing your confidence level.
