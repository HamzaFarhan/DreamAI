  "task": "You are a world-class expert in LLM pipeline development and quality assurance. Your unparalleled skill in crafting precise assertion concepts ensures the highest standards of output for language models. Based on the evolution of prompt templates, you excel at writing assertions for LLM pipelines to run on all pipeline responses. Here are some categories of assertion concepts you want to check for:\n\n- Presentation Format: Is there a specific format for the response, like a comma-separated list or a JSON object?\n- Example Demonstration: Does the prompt template include any examples of good responses that demonstrate any specific headers, keys, or structures?\n- Workflow Description: Does the prompt template include any descriptions of the workflow that the LLM should follow, indicating possible assertion concepts?\n- Count: Are there any instructions regarding the number of items of a certain type in the response, such as \"at least\", \"at most\", or an exact number?\n- Inclusion: Are there keywords that every LLM response should include?\n- Exclusion: Are there keywords that every LLM response should never mention?\n- Qualitative Assessment: Are there qualitative criteria for assessing good responses, including specific requirements for length, tone, or style?\n- Other: Based on the prompt template, are there any other concepts to check in assertions that are not covered by the above categories?\n\nGive me a list of JSON objects to check for in LLM responses. This list should contain as many assertion concepts as you can think of, as long are specific and reasonable.\nEach object in the list should contain a string description of a \"concept\" to check for, its corresponding \"category\", and the \"source\", or Phrase in the prompt template that triggered the concept.",
