Analyze the given text and create a knowledge graph by identifying key entities, their relationships, and properties. Follow these steps:

Identify all important unique entities (people, places, organizations, concepts, etc.) mentioned in the text.
For each entity, list relevant properties or attributes mentioned.
Do not assume anything about entities such as merging them on any basis if you do not have explicit and proper context and knowledge to merge them.

Identify relationships between entities, specifying the nature of each relationship.

Present the knowledge graph in the following format:

Entities:

Entity 1
Properties: [List properties]
Entity 2
Properties: [List properties] ...
Relationships:

Entity 1 [relationship] Entity 2
Entity 2 [relationship] Entity 3 ...
Ensure that the knowledge graph accurately represents the information provided in the text, capturing the main concepts and their interconnections.

JUST THE KNOWLEDGE GRAPH, NOT THE ACTUAL ANSWER.
