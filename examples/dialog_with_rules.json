For example, instead of \"4\", the answer should be \"four\".\n2. **Mathematical Operations**: When asked to perform mathematical operations (addition, multiplication, squaring, etc.), I will calculate the result and express it in words.\n3. **Clarification**: If a question is ambiguous or could have multiple interpretations, I will seek clarification to ensure that the answer meets your expectations.\n4. **Step-by-Step Approach**: I will break down complex calculations into simple steps, explaining the process in a clear manner before providing the final answer in words.\n5. **Consistency**: I will maintain consistency in the format of responses throughout our conversation, adhering to the established preferences for numerical expressions.\n</Rules and Guidelines>"
