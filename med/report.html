Medical Coding: An AI-Powered Approach</h1>
<h2 id="our-approach">Our Approach</h2>
<h3 id="vector-database-for-large-code-sets">1. Vector Database for
Large Code Sets</h3>
<p>One of the primary challenges in medical coding is dealing with
extensive code sets. We had 74,209 ICD codes and 11,241 CPT codes, which
together amount to approximately 2.5 million tokens when loaded into a
single prompt. This far exceeds even the most advanced LLMs’ context
windows, including Gemini Pro’s 2 million token capacity. Not only would
this overwhelm the model’s processing capabilities, but it’s simply not
possible to input such a large amount of data in a single prompt. To
address this, we employ a vector database (LanceDB) that supports hybrid
search, combining full text search and semantic similarity.</p>
<p>For modifiers, however, we don’t use LanceDB. There are only 426
modifiers, which is a manageable number that can easily fit within the
LLM’s context window. This allows us to include the full set of
modifiers directly in our LLM call, eliminating the need for an
additional database query step and potentially improving processing
speed for this particular code set.</p>
<p><strong>Justification:</strong> This approach allows us to
efficiently search and retrieve relevant codes without overwhelming the
LLM or compromising on performance, while also optimizing the handling
of the smaller modifier set. By using a vector database, we can work
with our extensive code sets in a way that’s both computationally
feasible and effective for accurate code selection.</p>
<h3 id="keyword-extraction-from-patient-charts">2. Keyword Extraction
from Patient Charts</h3>
<p>To enhance the search process, we use an LLM to extract keywords and
phrases from patient charts. This step helps in focusing the search on
the most relevant information.</p>
<p><strong>Justification:</strong> Extracted keywords provide a more
targeted input for the vector database search, improving the relevance
of retrieved codes. Compared to sending the chart content as-is, this
approach offers several advantages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Noise Reduction:</strong> Patient charts often contain
extraneous information. Keyword extraction filters out this noise,
focusing on the most pertinent medical terms and conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Improved Search Efficiency:</strong> By using targeted
keywords, we can perform more precise searches in our vector database,
potentially reducing the number of irrelevant codes retrieved.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contextual Understanding:</strong> LLMs can extract not
just individual words but also meaningful phrases, capturing the context
that might be missed in a simple word-matching approach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Standardization:</strong> Different doctors may use
varying terminology. An LLM can help standardize these terms to match
our code descriptions more closely.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Handling of Synonyms:</strong> LLMs can recognize and
extract synonymous terms, improving the chances of matching with the
correct codes even when the exact terminology in the code description
isn’t used in the chart.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>While sending the chart content as-is might seem simpler, it could
lead to less accurate code retrieval, especially for complex cases where
the relevant information is buried within lengthy narratives. Our
keyword extraction step strikes a balance between leveraging the full
context of the chart and providing focused input for efficient code
matching.</p>
<h3 id="targeted-code-retrieval">3. Targeted Code Retrieval</h3>
<p>Using the extracted keywords and chart content, we query the vector
database to retrieve a shortlist of 100 ICD and 100 CPT codes. This
shortlist is much more manageable for the LLM to process.</p>
<p><strong>Justification:</strong> This step significantly reduces the
number of codes the LLM needs to consider, making the process more
efficient and accurate.</p>
<h3 id="structured-data-extraction-with-pydantic">4. Structured Data
Extraction with Pydantic</h3>
<p>We use Pydantic models to define the structure of the output XML
schema. This approach, combined with the Instructor library, forces the
LLM to respond in a fixed schema rather than free-form text.</p>
<p><strong>Justification:</strong> Structured output ensures consistency
and adherence to the required XML format, reducing the need for
post-processing and error correction.</p>
<h3 id="final-code-assignment">5. Final Code Assignment</h3>
<p>The LLM is provided with the chart content, shortlisted ICD and CPT
codes, and modifier codes. It then extracts the relevant information and
returns a structured Claim object.</p>
<h2 id="advantages-of-our-approach">Advantages of Our Approach</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Can handle large code sets
efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Reduces human error through AI-powered
code selection.</li>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> Significantly faster than manual
coding.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Ensures uniform coding practices
across different charts.</li>
<li><strong>Cost-effectiveness:</strong> Reduces the need for human
coders, lowering operational costs.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="alternative-approaches-and-why-ours-is-optimal">Alternative
Approaches and Why Ours is Optimal</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Full LLM Processing:</strong> Using an LLM to process the
entire code set would be inefficient and prone to errors due to context
window limitations.</li>
<li><strong>Rule-Based Systems:</strong> While potentially faster, these
lack the flexibility to understand nuanced medical language and
context.</li>
<li><strong>Keyword Matching Only:</strong> This might miss important
context and lead to inaccurate code assignments.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our hybrid approach combines the strengths of vector databases for
efficient search, LLMs for understanding medical context, and structured
data models for accurate output. This balance makes our solution optimal
for handling the complexities of medical coding while maintaining
efficiency and accuracy.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-and-future-work">Challenges and Future Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>Limited sample data: Currently working with 3 AI-generated sample
charts and XMLs. Real-world testing with actual patient data will be
crucial for validation.</li>
<li>Continuous updates: Medical codes are regularly updated. Our system
is already built to accommodate these changes efficiently.</li>
<li>Fine-tuning for specialties: Different and rare medical specialties
may require specialized models or additional training data.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Our AI-powered approach to medical coding offers a promising solution
to automate and improve the accuracy of the coding process. By
leveraging advanced technologies like vector databases and large
language models, we can significantly reduce the time and cost
associated with medical coding while potentially improving accuracy. As
we move forward, real-world testing and continuous refinement will be
key to ensuring the system’s effectiveness across various medical
scenarios.</p>
