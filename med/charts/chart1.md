**Chief Complaint:**  Right knee pain and stiffness for the past 3 months, worsening after a fall last week.

**History of Present Illness:** The patient reports experiencing pain and stiffness in her right knee for approximately three months. The pain is described as a dull ache, localized to the medial aspect of the knee, and is exacerbated by weight-bearing activities.  The stiffness is most pronounced in the morning and improves with movement.  She denies any locking or giving way of the knee.  Last week, she tripped and fell, landing directly on her right knee. Since then, the pain and stiffness have significantly increased.

**Past Medical History:**  Hypertension, well-controlled with medication.

**Medications:** Lisinopril 10mg daily.

**Allergies:**  Penicillin.

**Physical Exam:**  The right knee demonstrates mild swelling and tenderness to palpation along the medial joint line. Range of motion is slightly decreased due to pain. There is no evidence of effusion.  No instability is noted.

**Assessment:**  Right knee pain and stiffness, likely osteoarthritis exacerbated by recent trauma.

**Plan:**
* Radiograph of the right knee.
* Ibuprofen 600mg every 6 hours as needed for pain.
* Follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to review imaging results.
