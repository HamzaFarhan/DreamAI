I am creating  a tool that will take medical patient charts and then use AI to extract the information based on a defined XML schema. This will be called a Claim.

CLAIM
Here is a description of the claim xml structure:
<claim>
   <carrier-code> The standard code identifying the payer (eg MC051 is Medi-Cal) </carrier-code>
   <state> The standard 2-character state abbreviation code (eg. VT for Vermont) </state>
   <practice> Any identifier you care to send that uniquely identifies the practice </practice>
   <provider> The provider's NPI number </provider>
   <default-place-of-service> A 2-character place of service code </default-place-of-service>
   <date-of-service> The date of service in yyyy-mm-dd format </date-of-service>
   <patient>
      <medical-record-number> Any identifier you care to send that uniquely identifies a particular patient </medical-record-number>
      <birth> The patient's birthdate in yyyy-mm-dd format </birth>
      <gender> Patient's gender (M for male, F for female) </gender>
   </patient>
   <procedure-list>
      <procedure>
         <procedure-code> A CPT or HCPCS code </procedure-code>
         <from-date> The starting date on which the procedure was performed. This field is optional if it's value is the same as the date-of-service </from-date>
         <to-date> The ending date on which the procedure was performed. This field is optional if it's value is the same as the date-of-service </to-date>
         <modifier-list>
            <modifier-code> A 2-character modifier code </modifier-code>
         </modifier-list>
         <diagnosis-list>
            <diagnosis-code> An ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM code <diagnosis-code>
         </diagnosis-list>
         <place-of-service> A 2-character place of service overriding the default-place-of-service </place-of-service>
         <units> Number of procedure units </units>
         <unitstime> Number of minutes spent doing the procedure (optional) ; </units>
      </procedure>
   </procedure-list>
</claim>
Notes:
The <procedure-list> element may contain one or more <procedure> elements.
The <modifier-list> element may contain 0 to 4 modifiers. It must appear, even if it contains no child elements.
Each element may contain an "ID" attribute with a value of your choosing. The Claim Scrubber will report the value of the ID when it issues a message. You can use it for whatever purpose you like, but it's intent is for conveniently tying the message to some element of your program's data structure.

I've uploaded the possible ICD, CPT, and Modifier codes with descriptions
Generate 3 sample medical charts for my experiments. Make the  charts so that other than the codes, everything else is explicitly stated. My AI will try to infer the ICD+CPT+Modifier codes using the code descriptions and the examination and procedure details etc, and it will extract all of the other available information as it is into the XML.
Give me the charts as 3 separate markdown code blocks. For each chart, I also want the XML ground truth in the same schema as defined above. in its own code block.
Each chart should have multiple codes including ICD+CPT+Modifiers. Don't make them empty.
Make them realistic. Something a doctor would actually right.
For the XMLs, MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THE SCHEMA EXACTLY.
